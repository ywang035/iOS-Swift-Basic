## Class or Structure?
Because classes and structures are so similar, it can be hard to know when to use classes and when to use structures for the building blocks of your program.
As a basic rule, you should start new types as structures until you need one of the features that classes provide.
Start with a class when youâ€™re working with a framework that uses classes or when you want to refer to the same instance of a type in multiple places.
